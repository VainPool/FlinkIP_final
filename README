This project uses Flink to implement TPC-H 5th query by algorithm described in the thesis(https://www.cs.utah.edu/~lifeifei/papers/cquirrel-vldb21.pdf)
to check if the query result is the same as RDBMS(MySQL) result.
------------------------------------------------------------------
Preparation:

1. The source data files are generated using TPC-H dbgen tools. Generated files should be placed under "/input" directory.(or user can modify the main function code to read from specified directory)
2. If you want to execute /streamComputation/StreamDataApiForCheck, please ensure you have prepared a MySQL DB and corresponding user/configuration
for data importing for MySQL.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Execution:

There are three main functions in streamComputation package:
1. StreamSQLAPI uses Flink table API to query, result will be printed for every matched record.
2. StreamDataAPI uses self-defined process function to query, result will be printed for every matched record.
3. StreamDataApiForCheck do preprocess to evenly group all data into 4 groups, shuffled the data and combined them into one single file.

All filter conditions can be manually set in each main functions by changing corresponding variants values.

StreamDataAPI accept absolute data file path as input. The default value for the file path is "input/", which is the corresponding
directory under this project.

Two input is required for StreamDataApiForCheck execution: stop place and whether to do preprocess
1) Stop place(25%, 50%, 75% or 100%) controls the datasource reading progress. Datasource will stop reading at stop place for user to check
if results match with RDBMS results at specific percentage.
2) Whether to do preprocess(Y or N) controls the preprocess execution.
User should set it to "Y" if executed for the first time or want to do re-shuffle and check for different shuffled results.
User should set it to "N" if want to compare results with RDBMS for same shuffle but different stop place(percentage of data).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
MySQL Checking:

1. The preprocess will import all data to MySQL with percentage tag with column name "perc".
2. "perc" column evenly tagged data in all table for 4 groups:
0-25% data: 0
25%-50% data: 1
50%-75% data: 2
75%-100% data: 3
3. User can check corresponding percentage of data by adding where clause for every table(for example for 75% data add where perc < 3)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Attention:
1. The where clause parameter in query can be manually set by modifying "inputDate" and "selectedRegion".
2. Preprocess in StreamDataApiForCheck will read all files into RAM. It is not suggested to execute it for large files.
3. StreamDataApiForCheck is programmed for testing in virtual flink environment in JVM. It is not suggested to execute it on cluster mode.
4. Import to MySQL can be slow. Please wait until all data files are imported to MySQL. For the same reason, it is not suggested to test with
large set of data.
5. When execute on cluster, please modify the source table directory accordingly.
